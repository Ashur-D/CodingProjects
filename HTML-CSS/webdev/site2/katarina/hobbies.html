                I love playing video games! ever since I was young I have been playing video games, 
                and still up to this age. I started playing on xbox, ps4 and wii when was I young.
                I also used to play on iPhones and iPads.

                Around middle school I had access to a PC
                and it was a very exciting, whats was even more exciting was when I got my OWN PC at
                the start of highschool that I have been using ever since. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Having a PC of my own has gave me access to tons of software and info that I learned.
                More importantly gaming, I get to play the games I love like Elden Ring, Nier Automata,
                Terraria, Hollow Knight, Subnautica, No Mans Sky, and so much more!
