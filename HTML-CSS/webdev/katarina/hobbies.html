            <p>
                I love playing video games! ever since I was young I have been playing video games, 
                and still up to this age. I started playing on xbox, ps4 and wii when was I young.
                I also used to play on iPhones and iPads.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around middle school I had access to a PC
                and it was a very exciting, whats was even more exciting was when I got my OWN PC at
                the start of highschool that I have been using ever since. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Having a PC of my own has gave me access to tons of software and info that I learned.
                More importantly gaming, I get to play the games I love like Elden Ring, Nier Automata,
                Terraria, Hollow Knight, Subnautica, No Mans Sky, and so much more!

                Finance
            </h1>
            <p>
                I took a personal finance class in grade, it was in my first semester around a year ago
                and I beleive to this day that it was one of the most important classes I have ever taken
                as it fueled my intrest into this type of stuff. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I Learned about taxes,budgeting,stocks,etc. Stocks and ETF's was a huge intrest for me and
                when I couldnt invest I would ask my parents to sign up an account for me as it was intresting to me,
                Once I turned 18 I opened up my first TFSA and started investing. Using the prior knownledge from before
                and keeping up with the news and companies, as well as politics give you a better view when deciding to invest.
            </p>

            <p>
                I currently invest for the long term as I only have my money in stocks, although crpyto seems intresting
                it is too volatile for me. Thats another thing, you should NEVER let your emotions affect your decision when
                picking out stocks and selling them, as that was one of, if not the most important things you learn if you
                decide to do this type of stuff.
