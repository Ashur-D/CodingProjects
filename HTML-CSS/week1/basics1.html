URLs and URL tags 
<a href="URL" target="_blank"> HTML Basics </a>`
- href takes in the abs url.
- target should be named either blank for new tab or the same as the existing href so that it will either refresh and open an already existing tab or make a new one
- lastly outside the <a> but before it ends should the displayed name you see for the link provided


Types of URLs
1. Absolute URL - full web address: starts with https:// >>> go to pages on other servers
2. Virtual URL - starts with / >>> goes to the root of our server
3. Relative URL - it starts from the current directory >>> if you want to go forward, put folder or file, to go back do ../ >> most flexible way to go to pages on our site
