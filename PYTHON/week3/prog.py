#working with variables and numbers

# in python variables can take intgers (integers cannot have decimals) or floats (floats can have decimals)

value1 = 139 # integer that takes 4 bytes in RAM
value2 = -26 # floats take 8 bytes in RAM
sum1 = value1 + value2 #sum1 is a variable
print("The sum of", value1, "and", value2, "is", sum1)
